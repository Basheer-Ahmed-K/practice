### StructType and StructField in PySpark

In PySpark, `StructType` and `StructField` are fundamental classes used for defining the schema of a DataFrame. Here's what each of these classes represents:

1. **StructType**: 
   - `StructType` represents a schema or structure for a DataFrame. 
   - It is analogous to a table schema in a relational database, defining the column names and data types.

2. **StructField**: 
   - `StructField` represents a field or column within a DataFrame schema.
   - It contains metadata about the name, data type, nullable flag, and other properties of the column.
   - Each `StructField` object is associated with a column in the DataFrame, defining its characteristics.

Together, `StructType` and `StructField` allow users to define a structured schema for their DataFrame, specifying the names and properties of the columns along with their data types. This schema provides a blueprint for the DataFrame's structure, ensuring consistency and enabling efficient data processing and manipulation.
