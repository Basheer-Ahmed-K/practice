# Window Functions in PySpark

Window functions in PySpark are powerful tools for performing complex data analysis and transformations on large datasets. They allow you to perform calculations on a subset of data within a specified window or group, rather than across the entire dataset.

## Row Number

The `row_number()` function assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition of the dataset. This can be useful for identifying and numbering rows based on certain criteria.

## Rank

The `rank()` function assigns a rank to each row within a partition of the dataset, with ties receiving the same rank value. For example, if multiple rows have the same value and are ranked third, the next row will be assigned a rank of fifth (not fourth).

## Dense Rank

The `dense_rank()` function is similar to `rank()`, but it does not leave gaps in the ranking sequence when there are ties. Instead, it assigns consecutive ranks to rows, even if they have the same value.

These window functions can be applied using the `over()` clause in PySpark SQL or DataFrame API, allowing you to specify the partitioning and ordering criteria for the window. They are particularly useful for tasks such as ranking, aggregation, and cumulative calculations.
